## 🔹 1. CPU

* Think of the CPU as the **brain of your PC**.
* Example: When you open **Chrome + MS Word + Spotify**, the CPU decides which one runs at a given time.

---

## 🔹 2. Core

* A **core** is like a worker inside the CPU.
* A CPU can have **multiple cores** (workers).

* Each core can execute one (or two, with hyper-threading) threads at a time.
* Example:

  * You have a **quad-core CPU**.
  * Chrome can run on **Core 1**, Word on **Core 2**, Spotify on **Core 3**, and maybe background antivirus on **Core 4**.

---

## 🔹 3. Thread

* The **smallest unit of execution** inside a process.
* Example in **Chrome**:

  * Thread 1 → Handle UI (buttons, menus).
  * Thread 2 → Load webpages.
  * Thread 3 → Play YouTube video.
  * Thread 4 → Run extensions.
* Example in **MS Word**:

  * Thread 1 → Typing and text rendering.
  * Thread 2 → Spell checker running in background.
  * Thread 3 → Auto-save feature.

---

## 🔹 4. Program

* A **program** is just the application stored on disk (before running).
* Example:

  * `chrome.exe` (Google Chrome program)
  * `WINWORD.EXE` (MS Word program)
  * `spotify.exe` (Spotify program)

👉 These are files until you **double-click them**.

---

## 🔹 5. Process

* When you **run a program**, it becomes a **process** (running instance).
* Example:

  * Opening Chrome = **Chrome process**.
  * Each Chrome **tab** may even run as a separate **process** (so one crashing tab doesn’t crash all).
  * Opening Word twice (two docs) → 2 **Word processes**.

---

## 🔹 6. Multitasking

* Running multiple processes **at the same time**.
* Example:

  * You can **watch YouTube on Chrome**, while **typing in Word**, and **listening to Spotify** at the same time.
* The OS scheduler quickly switches tasks between CPU cores/threads, so it feels simultaneous.

---

## 🔹 7. Task Assignment (by OS Scheduler)

* The **Operating System (Windows/Linux/macOS)** decides:

  * Which process gets which **core**.

  * Which thread runs first, and for how long (time slice).

  * Which process gets priority (e.g., keyboard input > background updates).
* Example:

  * **Core 1** → Chrome process (webpage + threads).
  * **Core 2** → MS Word process (typing + spell check).
  * **Core 3** → Spotify process (playback thread + download thread).
  * **Core 4** → Background antivirus.

---

## 🔹 8. Multithreading

* **Multiple threads inside one process**.
* Example in Chrome:

  * UI thread keeps browser responsive.
  * Rendering thread loads pages.
  * Network thread downloads data.
  * Extension thread runs plugins.
* Example in Word:

  * Typing text (main thread).
  * Spell check running simultaneously (background thread).
  * Auto-save writing file every few minutes (another thread).

👉 This is why Word doesn’t **freeze** when spell-check is happening, or Chrome can **play YouTube** while you scroll a different page.

---

## ⚠️ Important Clarification

> **Multithreading is not the same as Multitasking, and one is not “necessary” for the other.**

* **Multitasking** = OS runs **different processes** at once.
* **Multithreading** = A single process runs **multiple threads** at once.
* You can have:

  * **Multitasking without multithreading** → e.g., Run MS Paint (single-threaded) + Calculator + Chrome.
  * **Multithreading without multitasking** → e.g., Only Chrome running, but Chrome uses many threads.

👉 But in the real world, both happen together.

---


## 🔹 How cores are assigned

* The **Operating System scheduler** decides which process (or thread) runs on which **core**.
* **Cores are shared dynamically**, not fixed.
* A process (like Chrome) may run on **Core 1 now**, then get moved to **Core 2** later.
* If a process has **multiple threads**, those threads can be spread across **different cores**.

---

## 🔹 Example with Quad-Core CPU

Suppose you open **Word + Chrome + Spotify**:

* **Core 1** → runs Chrome’s UI thread.
* **Core 2** → runs Word’s typing thread.
* **Core 3** → runs Spotify’s music playback thread.
* **Core 4** → runs Chrome’s video playback thread.

👉 But if Spotify is paused (low load), the OS may move Word’s spell-check thread to Core 3.

---

## 🔹 Key Point

* **1 program ≠ 1 core**.
* Instead, **many processes and threads** share **many cores**.
* If you have **more programs than cores**, the OS will **time-slice** them:

  * Example: On Core 1, Chrome runs for 5 ms, then Word runs for 5 ms, then back to Chrome… so fast that you feel both run at the same time.

---

## 🔹 Real-World Analogy

Imagine a **restaurant with 4 chefs (cores)**:

* Customers = Programs.
* Dishes = Threads (tasks inside the program).
* A chef doesn’t cook for just one customer forever → they switch between orders.
* If one customer orders multiple dishes (multithreading), multiple chefs can help simultaneously.

---

✅ **So final answer:**

* A quad-core CPU can run **4 threads truly in parallel**.
* But **cores are not fixed to specific programs** → the OS scheduler assigns and reassigns threads as needed.

---

## 🔹 Situation

* CPU = **4 cores** (so 4 threads can run *truly in parallel*).
* You open **8 programs** (e.g., Word, Chrome, Spotify, WhatsApp Desktop, Excel, VS Code, Zoom, Notepad).

---

## 🔹 What Happens

1. **All 8 programs become processes.**

   * Each has its own memory and resources.
   * Each process may even have **multiple threads**.

2. **But only 4 cores are available.**

   * At any given instant, only **4 threads** can run in parallel.
   * But you have more threads than cores.

3. **OS Scheduler steps in.**

   * It **time-slices** between all 8 programs.

   * Example:

     * Core 1 → Chrome for 5 ms → then Word for 5 ms → then back to Chrome.
     * Core 2 → Spotify for 5 ms → then Excel for 5 ms → then back to Spotify.
     * Core 3 → Zoom for 5 ms → then Notepad.
     * Core 4 → VS Code for 5 ms → then WhatsApp.

   * This switching happens in **microseconds–milliseconds**, so fast you feel they all run together.

---

## 🔹 Important Points

* **No program gets “stuck waiting forever.”** The OS ensures fairness.
* If a program is **high priority** (e.g., Zoom video call), scheduler gives it **more CPU time** than a low-priority one (e.g., Notepad idle in background).
* This is why you can have **dozens of apps open** on your PC, even with a few cores.

---

## 🔹 Analogy (Restaurant with 4 Chefs 👨‍🍳👩‍🍳)

* **4 chefs (cores)**.
* **8 customers (programs)**.
* Chefs can cook only 4 dishes (threads) at once.
* The manager (OS scheduler) says:

  * “Chef 1, cook for Customer A for 5 mins, then switch to Customer B.”
  * “Chef 2, cook for Customer C, then switch to D.”
* Switching is so fast that customers feel like everyone is being served at the same time.

---

✅ **Final Answer**
If CPU has **4 cores** and you run **8 programs**, the OS uses **time-sharing** to make all 8 processes appear to run simultaneously. At any instant, only 4 threads execute in parallel, but rapid switching makes it feel like true multitasking.

---


## 🔹 Does CPU switch cores when you switch programs?

Yes — but **not only when you switch programs**.

Here’s how it works:

1. **OS Scheduler controls everything**

   * You don’t decide which program runs on which core.
   * The **Operating System (Windows/Linux/macOS)** assigns processes/threads to cores.

2. **Switching between programs (alt+tab, clicking)**

   * When you switch from Chrome → Word, the OS simply **gives Word’s process more priority and CPU time**.
   * This may happen on the **same core** or a **different core** — the scheduler decides.

3. **Core reassignment happens automatically**

   * A process is **not tied permanently to a core**.
   * Example:

     * Chrome might run on Core 1 now.
     * Next time the scheduler may move it to Core 3.
   * This depends on **load balancing** (to avoid overloading one core).

---

## 🔹 Example Scenario

* You have **4 cores**.
* Programs: Chrome, Word, Spotify, Zoom.

👉 At one instant:

* Core 1 → Chrome (UI thread).
* Core 2 → Word (typing thread).
* Core 3 → Spotify (music thread).
* Core 4 → Zoom (video thread).

👉 You switch to Word (alt+tab):

* OS makes Word’s UI + typing threads **higher priority**.
* Word might keep running on **Core 2**, OR OS may move some of Word’s threads to **Core 1 or Core 3** if they’re free.

👉 The switch feels **instant** because this all happens in **microseconds**.

---

## 🔹 Analogy

Imagine **4 chefs (cores)** in a kitchen:

* Chef 1 is cooking for Chrome.
* Chef 2 is cooking for Word.
* If you walk up and say: “I want Word NOW!” → the manager (OS) tells the chefs:

  * “Chef 2, focus more on Word.”
  * Maybe even: “Chef 1, leave Chrome for now, help with Word.”
