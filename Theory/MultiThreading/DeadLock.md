# 📝 Deadlock in Java — Complete Notes

---

## 🔹 1. What is Deadlock?

A **deadlock** occurs when two or more threads are **waiting forever** because each thread is holding a resource and waiting for another resource that another thread holds.

👉 Example:

* **Thread A** holds `lock1`, waiting for `lock2`.
* **Thread B** holds `lock2`, waiting for `lock1`.
  Neither can proceed → **deadlock**.

---

## 🔹 2. Coffman’s Four Conditions of Deadlock

Deadlock happens only if **all four conditions** are true at the same time:

1. **Mutual Exclusion** → A resource can be held by only one thread at a time.
2. **Hold and Wait** → A thread holds one resource and waits for another.
3. **No Preemption** → Resources cannot be forcibly taken from a thread; they must be released voluntarily.
4. **Circular Wait** → Threads form a cycle, each waiting for a resource held by the next.

⚡ Break any one of these conditions → deadlock is prevented.

## 🔹 3. Example of Deadlock in Java

```java
class DeadlockExample {
    private final Object lock1 = new Object();
    private final Object lock2 = new Object();

    public void method1() {
        synchronized (lock1) {
            System.out.println("Thread 1: Holding lock1...");
            try { Thread.sleep(100); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
            
            synchronized (lock2) {
                System.out.println("Thread 1: Holding lock1 & lock2...");
            }
        }
    }

    public void method2() {
        synchronized (lock2) {
            System.out.println("Thread 2: Holding lock2...");
            try { Thread.sleep(100); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
            
            synchronized (lock1) {
                System.out.println("Thread 2: Holding lock2 & lock1...");
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DeadlockExample obj = new DeadlockExample();
        new Thread(obj::method1, "Thread-1").start();
        new Thread(obj::method2, "Thread-2").start();
    }
}
```

👉 This program may **hang** because:

* Thread-1 locks `lock1` then waits for `lock2`.
* Thread-2 locks `lock2` then waits for `lock1`.
* **Deadlock** occurs.

## 🔹 4. Preventing Deadlock

### ✅ Rule 1: Lock Ordering (Most Common)

Define a **global order** for acquiring locks.

* Always acquire locks in the **same order**.
* Release them in the **reverse order**.

Example (Safe):

```java
synchronized(lock1) {
    synchronized(lock2) {
        // safe work
    }
}
```

If **all threads follow this order**, circular waiting is impossible.

❌ Unsafe (causes deadlock if mixed with above):

```java
synchronized(lock2) {
    synchronized(lock1) {
        // deadlock risk
    }
}
```

---

### ✅ Rule 2: Use `tryLock()` (with timeout)

Using `ReentrantLock`, a thread can try to acquire a lock **for a limited time**, preventing infinite waiting.

```java
if (lock1.tryLock(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)) {
    try {
        if (lock2.tryLock(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)) {
            try {
                // work safely
            } finally {
                lock2.unlock();
            }
        }
    } finally {
        lock1.unlock();
    }
}
```

---

### ✅ Rule 3: Acquire All Resources at Once

Require threads to acquire **all needed resources together**.
If unavailable, release everything and retry later.

---

### ✅ Rule 4: Avoid Nested Locks if Possible

Design systems to **minimize use of multiple locks**.
More nested locks = higher deadlock risk.

---

## 🔹 5. Clarifications to Doubts

### ❓ *If Thread A acquires `lock1`, can Thread B still acquire `lock2`?*

✔ Yes, if B needs **only `lock2`** (not `lock1`), it can take it whenever free.
✔ If B needs **both locks**, it must **first wait for `lock1`** (to follow the global rule).

---

### ❓ *What if Thread B “wants” lock2 → lock1 (reverse order)?*

❌ It cannot do that.
✔ To prevent deadlock, **all threads must obey the same lock order** (`lock1 → lock2`).
✔ If even one thread does `lock2 → lock1`, deadlock risk exists.

---

### ❓ *Does every thread need to follow the same rule?*

✔ Yes. The lock ordering rule is **global**.
Even if one thread breaks it, circular waiting can occur.

---

### 🔹 6. Real-World Analogy

Think of a **traffic intersection**:

* Rule: Cars must always cross from **North → South** first, then **East → West**.
* If everyone follows the same rule → smooth traffic, no jam.
* If one driver goes East → West first while others follow the opposite → traffic jam (deadlock).

---

# 🔹 Key Takeaways

* Deadlock happens when threads wait on each other in a cycle.
* Conditions: **mutual exclusion, hold & wait, no preemption, circular wait**.
* **Prevention**:

  * Use **lock ordering** (most common).
  * Use `tryLock()` with timeout.
  * Acquire all resources together.
  * Avoid nested locks when possible.
* **All threads must follow the same global rule** for locking.
